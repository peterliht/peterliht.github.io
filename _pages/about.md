I'm an EE PhD candidate at Stanford University supervised by [Prof. H.-S. Philip Wong](https://web.stanford.edu/~hspwong/). I also work closely with [Prof. Priyanka Raina](https://profiles.stanford.edu/priyanka-raina) and [Prof. Subhasish Mitra](https://web.stanford.edu/~subh/). My current research interests focus on in-memory computing enabled by emerging memory technologies (e.g., 3D vertical RRAM), with technical efforts spanning from device characterization and cross-stack modeling, to efficient architectures and their hardware realizations.

Published more than 30 papers appearing in top conferences (IEDM, ISSCC, VLSI, DAC) and journals (JSSC, Nature Electronics), including several invited papers. Our research has been featured on EE Times, Forbes, Storage Newsletter, Stanford News, ScienceNet, and PKU News. Meanwhile, I serve as an active reviewer for JSSC, Scientific Reports, EDL, T-ED, Applied Physics Letters, T-CAD, T-VLSI, and several IEEE conferences. 

I'm a recipient of 2016 IEEE EDS Masters Student Fellowship, Best Paper Award at 2016 SRC TECHCON, 'Golden List of Reviewers' by IEEE EDL and T-ED, and nomination for Best Student Paper Award at 2016 Symposium of VLSI Technology.
